# Personal website
## Description
Personal website aimed to showcase a few things that I've done. This page will be created using best design principles from Alex Xu's System Design book, component creation practices by Yangshun Tay's GreatFrontend.com, and Spring in Action by Craig Walls. Overall this will be a very valuable learning experience that I will work on in my free time.
